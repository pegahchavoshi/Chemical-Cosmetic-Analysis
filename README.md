## Chemical Cosmetic Analysis

# Introduction
Cosmetics have become a part of our lives worldwide, used by people of all ages and backgrounds. The variety of cosmetic products available has grown significantly, offering more choices than before. However, this growth has brought up concerns about the ingredients used in these products.

# Dashboard Overview
In this project, I focus on cosmetics and the chemicals they contain. My goal is to understand the potential health risks associated with certain chemicals found in cosmetics. I analyzed data from the California Safe Cosmetics Act over several years to shed light on the presence of harmful chemicals in different types of cosmetics.

# Problem
Cosmetic ingredients can be complex and not always well understood. This lack of knowledge can lead to using products that might have harmful chemicals, without us realizing it. This raises worries about our health and well-being.

# Solution
To tackle this issue, I've used data analysis. I've taken advantage of the information provided by the California Safe Cosmetics Act, which requires companies to report on risky ingredients. By analyzing this data and creating visual representations, I aim to help people understand what's in their cosmetics and make informed choices.

# Results
My analysis has revealed interesting insights. I've found trends in the reporting of chemicals over time, suggesting improvements in product safety. Moreover, I've identified specific companies and brands associated with higher levels of potentially harmful ingredients. This knowledge empowers consumers to be smarter about their cosmetic choices. This project is all about giving people the facts they need to make safer decisions

# Methodology:
I've relied on the data from the California Safe Cosmetics Act, which gives us a clear picture of the chemicals used in cosmetics. By digging into this data, I've uncovered patterns and connections between ingredients. Using graphs and charts, I've made this complex information easy to understand. My approach involves sorting through information, analyzing it, and presenting it in a way that benefits everyone.
